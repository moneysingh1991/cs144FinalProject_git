With the advent of Programmable Electronic 
Systems(PESs)in safety related lift systems, 
need has arisen to clarify those areas covered 
by the Safety Rules for the Construction of 
Lifts (162) where PESS may or may not, be 
applied. This paper is based on the guidelines 
prepared by the National Association of Lift 
Makers under the chairmanship of the writer. 
Theguidanceapplies ifoneormoreofthe safety 
related systems associated with a plant is a 
PES. It does not apply if an adequate level of 
safety is assured by one or more conventional 
systems, separate from the controlling PES, of 
conventional safety integrity or better. The 
conventional system will need to adequately 
cater for, amongstotherthings, failures ofthe 
controlling PES itself. 
GENERAL 
APES is a computer-basedsystemwhich controls, 
protects or monitors the operation of plant or 
machinery, it is made up of both hardware and 
software and is linked to the plant by sensors 
and actuators. 
When evaluating safety it is important to 
realise that PESS are fundamentally different 
from conventional control systems. For example, 
it is not always easy to predict the effect of 
the failure of a PES, or even to discover where 
the fault lies. PESs may be used to control or 
monitor safety circuits but should not be used 
to fulfil the function of a safety contact such 
as those listed in Appendix A of references 
(162). 
Very often computer controlled lift equipment 
is installed in place of conventional systems. 
In these cases, as a general guiding principle, 
the new systems should be at least as safe as 
the conventional one. However, as technology 
develops, there may not be a conventional 
equivalent and these guidelines combine sound 
lift engineering practice with the Health and 
Safety Executive recommendations of references 
(3b4)  toachievea satisfactory levelof safety. 
PESs can be used in a variety of ways and the 
consequences of failure may range from 
inconvenience to a dangerous situation. The 
safety measures adopted must be appropriate to 
theparticularapplicationandthedegreeofthe 
safety strategy needed will depend upon the 
level of hazard presented. 
WherePESs performa safety functionthey should 
be so designed that a combined failure or 
malfunction of hardware and software cannot 
reduce the level of safety integrity. 
When a new installation is being designed, or 
the s a f e t y o f a n e x i s t i n g o n e i s b e i n g a s s e s s e d ,  
it is essential to follow the following five 
logical and systematic steps to make sure that 
adequate safety precautions have been taken. 
The correct procedure to follow is shown as a 
flow chart in Appendix 1. 
Sten A - 
The first stage i n  any safety assessment is to 
identify thehazards, i.e. dangerous situations 
in which people are likely to be injured, and 
then find the chain of events that could lead 
to these hazards. This analysis has already 
been carried out for lifts and has resulted in 
a set of safety rules for electricandhydraulic 
lifts as covered by references ( l h 2 )  respectively. 
SteD B - Ide- of the Safetv-Related . .  .  
From the hazard analysis it is possible to 
identify the safety systems and decide whether 
they fall within the scope of this paper, 
bearing in mind that a safety related system is 
one upon which the safety integrity of the lift 
is to be assured. These systems can broadly be 
divided into two types - control systems and 
protection systems. 
When attempting to identify a safety related 
system it is important to note that although the 
breakdown of a programmable electronic control 
system might itself be part of a chain of events 
leading to a hazard, if it is effectively 
protected by a separate system which prevents 
the hazard arising, then the control system is 
not safety related and therefore does not have 
to comply with these guidelines. 
To assist in identifying safety related systems, 
Appendix 2 covers some ofthe potential hazards 
identified and some of the protection systems 
recommended in (1). Column 3 gives examples of 
how the use of a PES would make the application 
of these guidelines relevant. 
v 
A safety analysis has already been carried out 
for lifts in references ( l h 2 )  and the safety 
criteriahasbeenestabl ished.  This falls under 
three categories, examples of which are indicated 
in column 4 of Appendix 2 .  
All electric safety devices covered 
in Appendix A of references (1&2) which are 
defined as Qafetv c o w  only and which 
satisfy 14.1.2.2. PESs are not permitted for 
this category. 
All electric safety devices covered 
in Appendix A of references ( l h 2 )  which are 
defined as ' ' and which satisfy 
14.1.2.3. PESs can be used but the guidelines 
to use are those specified by HSSE for high 
reliability circuits in their publication 
'Programmable Electronic Systems in Safety 
RelatedApplications Part 2 -General Technical 
Guidelines' ( 4 ) .  
GateaorvC, Allother safety relatedconditions 
not covered by Category A or B above but 
protected by an electric device. PESS can be 
used provided they comply with the design 
guidelines which involve improving three 
fundamental aspects of an installation, the 
configuration, reliability and quality. These 
are described in detail below in Step D. 
Stev D - Desian of the Safety-Wated Svstem 
Confiouration. Three principles must be 
satisfied to provide an acceptable design and 
assessment strategy. These are: 
The combined number of PES and non-PES 
safety related systems which are capable, 
independently, of maintaining the lift in 
a safe state or of bringing the lift to a 
safe state when required should not be less 
than the number of conventional systems 
which have provided conventional safety 
integrity; and 
No failure, randomorsystematicofa single 
channel of progranunable electronics hardware 
should cause a dangerous mode of failure of 
the total configuration of safety related 
systems. It should be recognised that 
systematic hardware failures may affect 
all identical designs of programmable 
electronics; and 
Faults within the software associated with 
a single channel of programmable electronics 
shouldnotcauseadangerousmodeof failure 
of the total configuration of safety 
related systems. It shouldbe assumedthat 
a software fault will affect all identical 
software. 
These guidelines assume that the configuration 
of the relevant circuitry is covered by one of 
the following: 
Non PES control systems protected by a PES 
circuit. 
PES control system monitored by one or more 
PESs eachtotally independent oftheother. 
Hardware R- ~ l l  PESS used in either 
the control systemor protection circuitrymust 
satisfy a qualitative appraisal using engineering 
judgenent. Aspects of the programnable electronics 
which should be considered are: 
The extent to which the programmable 
electronics are usedtomonitorthe correct 
operation of critical items such as sensors 
and actuators using, for example, signal 
validity checks designed into the applications 
software. 
The extent andeffectiveness of measure sto 
ensure that critical failures of the 
programmable electronics do not remain 
unrevealed. Such measures include: 
sum checks or other means of detecting 
corruption of program or data stored in 
Read Only Memory (ROM). 
bit pattern tests or other means Of 
testing the correct functioning of 
Readhrite Memory (RAM). 
watchdog timer to detect program halt 
or loop conditions. 
power supply monitor to detect incipient 
failure. 
The effectiveness of the means by which 
safety is maintained on detection of a 
failure, either automatically or by alarms 
and operator response. 
the testing provisions of critical elements 
notnecessarilycoveredby (a) and (b) above 
including in particular the proof check 
intervals for the item in question. 
the predominant failure modes. 
the complexity and relative reliability Of 
the hardware. 
the adherence to applicable systems which 
may specify hardware failure criteria such 
as, for example, that no single failure 
should result in an unsafe condition. 
the degree of redundancy of all parts of 
the programmable electronics. 
SQftware Rellabllltv. The necessary phases of 
a software development will vary according to 
the systembut, typically, the following phases 
should be carried out to reflect high quality 
and good reliability of the software. 
(a) Requirements specification 
(b) Software specification 
(c) Software design 
(d) Software coding 
(e) Software test 
(f) System test 
All aspects of software production and change 
should only be carried out by authorised and 
competent personnel. Each phase ofthe software 
development program should be documented 
sufficiently in order to: 
. . .  
Allow adequate communication between all 
participants in the design program. 
Allow the design to be reviewed with agreed 
milestones as it proceeds. 
Allow each stage in the design tobe checked 
and approved on completion. 
Allow the operation of the software to be 
fully understood in the future. 
Allow changes to be incorporated in a 
controlled manner. 
Allow the full implications of changes to 
be evaluated. 
Clearly define the software being used on 
site. 
Oualitv. The minimum level of overall quality 
saiety related systems is specified-in (ai 
(b) as follows: 
The programmable 
electronics shouldbemanufacturedusingan 
established quality assurance system, such 
as BS 5750. Other parts of the PES should 
be to a level of quality not inferior to 
conventional safety integrity; and 
The safety 
related systems, particularly those that 
are PES based, should be engineered by 
competentandexperiencedpeoplewhounder- 
stand PES safety engineered principles 
related to lift systems. 
S b s ~  E - sa-
Once the design has been completed an analysis 
should be carried out to ensure that the 
required level of safety integrity for the 
safety related systems has been achieved. The 
analysis must extend to all those components, 
of safety related systems, whose failure could 
cause the safety related systems themselves to 
fail and affect the safety of the lift 
installation. 
The analysis must cover all three system 
elements of configuration, reliability and 
overall quality and therefore confirm that the 
requirements listed under safety categories B 
and C. 
P 
The design of the equipment, and 
the components used, must be suitable for the 
ambient temperature in which they are to work, 
there must be due regard for the temperature 
riseoftheequipmentitself andthe temperature 
under which the equipment may be stored and 
transported. 
The equipment must be protected from 
the effects of humidity during storage and 
operation, and particularly where there is a 
poss ib i l i tyof insta l lat ionbeingundertakenin  
initially unheated buildings. 
. .  
A Due 
consideration must be given, including during 
storage and transport, where the environment is 
suchtheremightbedust, corrosiveorexplosive 
atmospheres, and the design needs to take these 
into account. 
e - E- 
Electrical and electro-magnetic interference 
has four possible sources, it may be: 
(a) Mains borne 
(b) Generated by the lift control system 
(c) Generated by the PES itself 
(d) Radiated from external sources 
Interference such as spikes, surges and dips, 
flicker, harmonics and transients from these 
sources must not affect the PES in any way that 
reduces the level of safety. 
The equipment should be designed using sound 
engineeringpractice. Due consideration should 
begiventothequal i tyofpower supplies, logic 
andmains, along with earthbonding, screening, 
de-coupling, avoidance of earth loops and 
segregation of power/signal cables. 
Any suppression and filtering necessary to 
ensure correct operation of the PES, in order 
to achieve the required safety criteria, should 
be documented. This is to guard against the 
possibility of the suppression devices being 
removed or changed during the life of the 
equipment. 
Wectro-Static Dis-sD) Dam- Many 
devices used in electronic systens are susceptible 
to ESD damage. This damage is not necessarily 
destructive or immediately apparent, but can 
lead to intermittent faults or degraded 
performance. 
Steps should be taken during manufacture, 
storage, transport and installation of the 
equipmenttominimise risk and provide guidance 
on correct handling procedures. 
. .  
rv Devices, Adequate precautions 
should be taken to safeguard against the 
effects of X-rays and ultra-violet light 
radiation. 
Software for safety relatedapplications should 
be of a high quality to ensure reliable 
operation throughout its life. Qualitymust be 
considered fromthe outset to make certain that 
Software is correctly specified, designed, 
documented, tested and controlled. 
Adjustments to equipment operation parameters 
(e.g. door dwell times) on site using hardware 
jumpers, pinboard, switches etc. must be fully 
documented if they affect software functions. 
Records shouldbekepton siteandat theoffices 
of manufacturers and/or service organisations.
