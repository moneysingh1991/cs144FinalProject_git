The term analog Computation evokes numerous associations; 
the planimeter, the slide rule, the differential analyzer, and other 
physical  computing  devices  are  modeled  by  mathematical  equa- 
tions  with  diverse  applications.  By  drawing  a  careful  distinction 
between  analog  and  digital  computation,  it  becomes  possible  to 
compare the use of analog computation in the solution of various 
optimization  problems  with  the  use of digital  computation.  The 
famous  open  question of complexity  theory  for  digital  computa- 
tion,  whether or not  P = NP,  owes its practical  importance to the  
ability of the  Turing  machine  model  for  digital  computation to 
provide a realistic,  ideal  model  for  a  digital  computer.  It  being 
widely  assumed  that P # NP, NP-complete  decision  problems 
are  widely  regarded as intractable.  (Here  we  remind  the  reader 
that   this  kind of complexity analysis deals with worst case analysis 
of infinite  families of combinatorial  optimization  problems,  and 
intractability  refers  to  asymptotic  rate of growth of computational 
requirements for larger and larger problem instances. For further 
reference, see [GJ].) 
Can  analog  computation  be  used to solve  intractable  com- 
binatorial optimization problems, circumventing the apparent limi- 
ta t ions of digital  computation?  This  appears  to  be  unlikely, as 
argued in a recent paper [VSD]. Indeed, it appears to be a difficult 
task to arrange for an analog computation to solve even “simpler” 
problems  such as those in  class P in the asymptotic l imit .  The 
main thrust  of [VSD]  may  be  described as follows. If we change 
our viewpoint and adopt a thesis that  every analog computation 
can be simulated in polynomial time with a Turing machine, then 
the assumption that  P # NP implies certain consequences about 
the  behavior of analog  computers.  Following  [VSD],  we  call  the 
thesis  about  analog  computation  Strong  Church’s  Thesis  (SCT). 
The  validity of S C T  is  subject  to verification  using  various 
mathematical  models  for  analog  computation.  In  [VSD],  a class 
of differential  equation  models  is  shown  to  satisfy  SCT. 
Differential  equation  models  associated  with  NP-complete 
problems have been proposed in the literature. These provide an 
opportunity  to  explore  and  develop  interesting  complexity issues 
related to systems and control. Not all of these models correspond 
to analog  computations as formalized in [VSD].  Acommon 
shortcoming is the failure of the model to admit  a scaling that 
constrains  the  solutions  to evolve  in a polynomially-bounded 
hypercube in “configuration-space”, for a fixed level of precision of 
the  computation.  (I t  is an  assumption  about  analog  computa- 
tions that problem variables cannot be encoded into multidimen- 
sional  analog  quantities  whose  dimension  depends  on  the  numerical 
value, as in representing an integer with a variable-length binary 
string).  Analog  sorting  schemes  provide  a  simple  illustration of 
this  inherent  obstacle to solution of “numerical” problems by ana- 
log  means.  The  differential  equation  models for “nonnumerical”

problems can also suffer from this drawback. One topic to be dis- 
cussed in this talk is the “neural network” formulation proposed 
by Hopfield and T a n k  IHT] for the solution of the NP-complete 
Traveling Salesman Problem with systems described by differential 
equations. The scaling problem in this model arises from the use 
of a  sigmoid-type  nonlinear  amplifier  characteristic  with  large  gain. 
We will also present a discussion of a  dynamic  system associ- 
ated with a linear programming problem, and related to the NP- 
complete problem 3-SAT, Boolean satisfiability of a conjunction 
of three-term  disjunctions.  The  model  differs  from  the  static 
model presented in [VSD]. Empirical evidence and analysis suggest 
some  connections  with  ergodic  theory  and  complex  dynamics 
(cham). Our results  support  the  conjecture  that  the  number of 
collisions  with  constraint  boundaries  grows  exponentially, as is 
predicted  by  the  basic  thesis of analog  computation  and  the 
assumption  that  P # NP. A  second  model,  based  on  a  time- 
optimal control problem, will also be illustrated. The basic thesis 
of analog computation and the assumption that P # NP combine 
to  imply  that  the  optimal  bang-bang  control  law  requires  an 
exponential  number of switches in the  worst  case.  The  validity 
of this  prediction will be  discussed.
