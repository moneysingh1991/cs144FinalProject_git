1 Introduction 
The integration of object-oriented programming concepts 
wi th databases i s  one of the most significant advances in  the 
evolution of database systems and several recent projects are 
developing object-oriented databases Among the many issues 
brought along by this combination, one that i s  becoming 
important I S  the protection of information 
Most of the current models for authorization in database 
systems were developed for relational databases [Fern81, Grif761 
Object-oriented databases have a much richer structure and thore 
models are not adequate The addition of semantic relationships 
makes the authorization problem even more complex There IS a 
need for new models Until now very few authorization models 
for object-oriented databases have been proposed [Rabi87, 
Rabi881 A related study [Tost881 considers a Smalltalk system 
without a database system 
We develop here an authorization model for object 
oriented databases This model consists of a set of policies, a 
structure for authorization rules, and an algorithm to evaluate 
access requests against the authorization rules For concreteness 
we use a specific database system, which i s  n o w  under 
development at the University of Florida This system Intended 
for CAD/CAM applications, incorporates knowledge rules wi th a 
database of objects combined through an Object Oriented 
Semantic Association Model (OsAM*) ([SuSY8S].[SuSY88]) The 
database i s  composed of objects that include a collection of facts 
and a collection of relevant rules An object binds knowledge 
rules t o  database facts

All the knowledge manipulation operations can be used t o  
express the rules Some of these rules could be integrity or 
security rules, I e ,  they could be the basis for a mechanism to  
enforce integrity or security 
Section 2 considers security policies and the structure of the 
authorization rules for such a system, while Section 3 discusses 
access requests validation Section 4 develops an algorithm for 
access validation in  the context of the OSAM* model, Section 5 
shows some possible extensions, while the last section describes 
conclusions and directions for future worh 
2 Securitv policies and authorization rules 
A coherent set ot policies i s  needed as a guideline for the 
design and use of a database system The choice of policies for 
security i s  important because it can influence the flexibility. 
usability, and performance of the system [Fern811 
A fundamental choice i s  having an open or a closed system 
In an open system everything i s  accessible unless forbidden, while 
in  a closed system we have the inverse situation Security requires 
closed systems while flexibility indicates open systems In general, 
when security i s  an important objective, we should use a closed 
system Another issue i s  the use o f  positive or negat ive 
authorization rules, For example, the system described in [Rabi87] 
uses positive and negative authorizations a subject may be 
denied access t o  an object either because it has no authorization 
for it or because it has a negative authorization on it The use of 
predicates for  negative author izat ion present evaluat ion 
problems as well as possible contradictions i n  the security 
structure which may be hard t o  detect However, in a system with 
a rich data model negative authorizations may be needed to  
express subtle access constraints Negative author izat ion 
constraints are also required by the Orange book for security 
classes 83 and A1 [DODCSS ] 
Another dimension i s  ownership versus administration In 
the first case users own and administer their data, in the second 
case the information belongs to  the enterprise, users are given 
access t o  i t  t o  perform their  functions and special users 
(administrators) control the structure and the use o f  t h e  
information Since a Data Base Management System i s  used to  
support an enterprise, administration i s  a more logical choice for 
this case This view i s  also supported by recent work on enterprise 
policies [Moff88] Additionally one may want to allow some (or 
all) user to  define private databases 
Another relevant policy i s  the choice between discretionary 
and multilevel security The National Computer Security Center 
recommends the  use o f  mu l t i leve l  systems fo r  genera l  
computational environments [DoDC851 For the environment 
considered here a discretionary pol icy seems adequate

development at SRI and Honeywell 
Figure 1 illustrates a portion of a university database using 
the OSAM* model (A few other concepts are introduced in the 
example of Section 3) Class Person (P) has attributes SSN (Social 
Security Number), Name (and maybe others) Classes Student (5) 
and Teacher (T) are subclasses of Person The generic properties 
of Student and Teacher define Person through a generalization 
association (G in Figure 1) Attribute "Year"(year of graduation) 
i s  defined for Student and attribute "Course" for Teacher 
Foreign Student (FS) i s  a subclass of Student Attributes defined 
for subclasses reflect the fact that some features or properties 
only apply to specific subclasses, e g , Visa is  only meaningful for 
Foreign Students Person, Student, Teacher, and Foreign Student 
are object classes (similar to Smalltalk classes) Their attributes 
correspond to Smalltalk tnstance vartab/eS In addition to the 
generalization association, Figure 1 also shows an aggregation 
association indicated by A, which defines a set of attributes for 
some class 
Class inheritance properties make Figure 1 to define the 
effective ddtabase of Figure 2, where i t  can be seen that all 
attributes of a class are inherited by its subclasses (the dotted 
attributes are the inherited attributes) I t  is  clear now that access 
to  zome at t r ibute o f  a class implies also access to  the 
corresponding values in i t s  subclasses Note that these values are 
a subset of those of the superclass. I e ,  SSN as an attribute of  
Student represents only the SSNs of Students, while the values of 
SSN as an attribute of Person represent SSNs of Students as well 
as of Teachers 
' 
These considerations can be summarized in the following 
micies 
P1 (inheritance policy) - a user that has access to a class IS 
allowed to have similar type of access in the corresponding 
subclasses to  the attributes inherited from that class 
P2 - -  access to  a complete class implies access t o  the 
attributes defined in that class as well as i o  attributes 
inherited from a higher class (but only to the class-relevant 
values of these attributes) 
P3 -- an attribute defined for a subclass I S  not accessible by 
accessing any of i t s  superclasses 
Additional policies are necessary to consider predicates and 
multiple inheritance A discussion of possibilities for discretionary 
and mandatory systems i s  given in [Spoo88] 
In general, an authorization rule is a tuple (U, A 0, p, f), 
which defines that sublect or user U has authorization of type A 
(access type) to  those occurrences of object class 0 for which 
predicate p is  true (note that the word object here i s  not used in 
the sense of  object-oriented databases but i t  represents any 
named entity) User U can grant the access right (0,A) i f  the 
copy flag f i s  true This model has been used to describe most of 
the authorization systems for relational databases We use here a 
more specific version of these rules defined as below 
An authorization rule i s  a triple (U,A,AO) where U i s  a user 
or user group, A is an access type or set of access types, and A 0  i s  
the set of attributes of the object to be accessed, I e ,A 0 = (01 a,. 
01 a2, } A rule can either refer to A 0  as a whole or to i t s  
individual components Attribute a, must be defined for object 
01, or inherited by i t  
For example, consider the graph of Figure 2 Assume the 
following authorization rules are defined 
R1 (SA, R, 5 SSN) ~ - The Student Advisor can read SSN 
of students 
R2  (FSA, R, (FS SSN, FS visa)) 
Advisor can read SSN and visa of foreign students 
- The Foreign Student 
A Student Advisor (SA) could have access to  SSNs of all 
students (Pi), but no access to  their visas (P3), a Foreign Student 
Advisor (FSA) could have access to  visas but only to  SSNs o f  
Foreign Students (Pz) 
We can also separate user rtghts defined by user 
authorization rules as described above from administrative rights. 
the ability to control the database access actions Administrative 
rights are defined by admtnistrative rules described by tuples (U, 
A, 0,  f) Examples of administrative access types are the rights to 
create and delete administrative groupings of data, to define user 
authorization rules, t o  revoke delegated rights. etc This 
separation proved t o  be useful in  a decentralized model 
[Wood79) and has been further elaborated in (Moff881

3 Validation of access requests 
Access validation occurs by extracting a data request from a 
user query or from an executing program This request has a 
structure (U’,A’, O’), where U’ i s  the subject (user, process) 
making the request, 0’ i s  the requested object, and A‘ IS the 
requested access type This request i s  validated against the 
authorization rules to decide if the request should be granted 
totally or partially 
A security context i s  a set o f  object classes grouped 
together for security purposes A security context may be 
equivalent t o  a conventional view or other partitions of the 
database schema A security context defines a partially ordered 
set of object classes (in terms of the associations) which delimits 
the access for user queries, i e ,  a data request i s  validated using 
the rules in a specific context In Figure 3 we show a more global 
picture of the university database Security Context S C i  IS 
defined t o  include Classes Person, Student, Teacher, and Foreign 
Student, as well as their corresponding associations Validation of 
a user’s request associated with this security context wi l l  only 
consider classes and associations within SCl  (the portion in the 
dotted circle) SC1 is used as a boundary when constructing the 
Query Security Graph (def ined later) for the  user’s query 
Authorization rules are usually associated w i t h  a partlcular 
security context 
Consider now rules R1 and R2 of Section 2 According to 
Placement rule 1, R1 must be placed at class Student Similarly, 
R2 can only be placed at class Foreign Student 
A query-graph IS  the subgraph of the security context 
defined by the nodes that the query intends t o  access and their 
corresponding associations 
For the example above we define the fo l low ing  t w o  
queries, each o f  which is issued by SA and FSA 
Q1: read SSN for all students 
Q2: read SSN and visa for all foreign students 
The corresponding query-graphs are shown in Figure 4

The placement of authorization rules affects considerably 
the way of validating access requests Authorization rules can be 
placed at special classes (e g , a context root), at the class to  which 
they refer (I e , the class defined by the object part of the rule), or 
propagated throughout the hierarchy as discussed in  [Fern751 
We consider the following placement rule 
Placement Rule 7 an access rule (U.A,{Oi al, 0, a l .  }) can be 
placed only at node 01 
I Foreignstudent I 
Query Graph for Q2 
Figure 4 Query-graphs for example 
According to the policies of Section 2 we expect the following 
behavior as a result of the evaluation of the indicated requests’ 
(SA.Ql) = (SA, Read, S SSN) - - all SSNs can be read (since 
we do not deal wi th exceptions or negative authorizations, 
we do not exclude, for example, foreign students or other 
subgroups tha t  may no t  be accessible t o  a student 
advisor )(Policy PI) 
(SA,Q2) = (SA, Read, {FS Visa, FS SSN)) - -only SSNs of 
foreign students are to  be read and not their visas. (Policy 
P3) 
(FSA,Ql) = (FSA, Read, S SSN) - - only foreign student SSNs 
are to be read (Policy Pz) 
(FSA.Q2)= (FSA, Read, {FS Visa, FS SSN}) - - both foreign 
student SSNs and visas are to  be read (Policy Pz) 
We now define the concept of the Query Security Graph 
for each node in the query graph we add all of i t s  descendants 
(recursively) and all of i t s  ancestors (recursively) until we reach the 
boundaries of the security context The result i s  the query security 
graph for example the query security graphs for queries Q1 and 
Q2 issued within SC1 are shown in Figure 5 (in this case this i s  the 
same graph for both queries) 
*We denote a request as (U.Q), where U i s  a subject and Q a 
query Their combination is equivalent to  the set of components 
of the request model defined in  Section 2 For clarity we show 
also the expanded request

4 Access request evaluation alqorithm 
This algorithm assumes Placement Rule 1 and that the 
security graph i s  a tree (a more general algorithm, that  can 
handle arbitrary class graphs, has been developed [fern891 ) for  
each node i n  the  query graph the  a lgor i thm checks fo r  
authorization in the corresponding node in the query security 
graph If i t  finds a rule authorizing all the requested access, it 
returns Otherwise i t  looks for more general rules in  the ancestor 
of the current node If still not fully authorized, it looks for more 
restrictive rules in i t s  descendant subtrees using, for example, a 
depth-first search procedure The algorithm i s  based on the 
policies defined earlier 
f o r  the algor i thm we use the fo l low ing  add i t iona l  
deftni tions 
AT - - set of requested attributes 
AT yes - - the set of attributes already authorized at a 
given moment 
QG i s  the query graph, SG i s  the query security graph 
AUTH UP and AUTH DOWN are procedures to traverse 
the tree 
The algorithm i s  composed of three major procedures 
- 
AUTH, AUTH-UP and AUTH-DOWN 
AUTH may traverse the entire query security graph for 
each node of  the query graph (the examples below assume a 
single query node ) If the current query node contains access 
rules which completely authorize access, then the algorithm stops 
and sets the set AT to empty, and the set AT yes t o  the set AT 
If only partial authorization i s  found (le ,-only some o f  the 
attributes in AT are authorized), this i s  indicated by substracting 
the authorized attributes from the set AT, and adding them to  
the set AT yes In this case. the security tree has to be traversed 
up and down looking for other authorizing rules This is  done by 
procedures AUTH-UP and AUTH 
AUTH UP looks for rules authorizing attributes in  the 
remaining set AT in all ancestors of the current node until the 
root o f  the SG On the way up, it may not be possible t o  find 
DOWN respectively - 
access rules for all attributes because some of them are not 
known at higher level nodes, and according to  placement rule 1 
they cannot be authorized there Therefore such attributes are 
temporarily eliminated from the set AT If at any point the set 
AT becomes empty, the traversal up stop, although this may not 
indicate full authorization because of the eliminated attributes 
If AUTH UP did not get the full authorization for the set 
AT, then A U m  DOWN must be invoked AUTH-DOWN 
traverses the subtree rooted in the current node in a depth-fbrst 
manner AUTH DOWN must consider restrictive authorization 
This means givins authorization to a subclass even i f  access to  the 
full class was requested (e g , giving access to only FS in case 
access t o  S was required ) In order to maximize authorization, 
all children of the current node must be searched However, once 
restrictive authorlzation was given t o  all attributes in  the set AT, 
there is  no need t o  search further down because n o  more 
authorization can be found 
After both procedures fimsh, either full authorization IS 
given (set AT i s  empty), or partial authorization i s  given by the 
set AT yes The set AT yes i s  then used by the  query 
evaluation algorithm to restzct access to authorized attributes

Now let us see how the algorithm works on the four cases 
above 
Case I (SA,Ql) = (SA, Read, S SSN) 
The algorithm finds rule R 1  and therefore gives SA access to  all 
SSNs 
Case2 (SA Q2) = (SA. Read, {FS SSN, FS Visa}) 
The algorithm first looks at node FS and cannot find any rules 
Then it looks at node S Now it updates AT by removing attribute 
"visa" since i t  is not known at this node and therefore no rule can 
reference i t  Now i t  finds the rule (SA,R.S SSN) and since obviously 
S includes FS it allows access to all SSNs for foreign students but 
not t o  their visas 
Case3 (FSA,Ql) = (FSA, Read, S SSN) 
The algorithm first looks at S and cannot find any rules Then i t  
looks at P and cannot find any rules Now i t  goes downwards and 
finds R2 It updates AT yes with FS SSN and therefore allows 
access to  SSNs of foreign zudents only 
Case4 (FSA.Q2) = (FSA, Read, {FS SSN, FS Visa}) 
The algorithm looks at FS, finds rule R 2  and allows access to both 
SSNs and visas 
5 Extensions 
We may want to  use a more general placement rule 
Placement Rule 2 an access rule (U,A,{Oi a l ,  01 a2 }) can 
be placed at any node A 0  such that 
( 1 )  A 0  i s  01 or one of i t s  ancestors 
(2) ai i s  known for object A 0  (I e ,  defined or inherited 
from above) 
If we use the second placement rule instead of the first, 
there are very few changes to  the algorithm The basic change i s  
that when we update AT yes we always have to  update i t  wi th 
RO AT and not wi th A 0  A i w h e r e  RO i s  the Object in the rule and 
not the object we are currently working on This i s  because RO 
may be more restrictive than A 0  
The second placement rule may be useful if we want to 
concentrate our authorization rules in higher level nodes, and 
also most of our queries try t o  access higher ievel nodes 
However, the distribution of queries versus access rules i s  not  
known in general 
Currently the algorithm repeats for each node of the query 
graph So i f  the query graph contains t w o  nodes and their 
corresponding security graphs overlap, we search portions of the 
same graph twice. which i s  redundant, the algorithm needs to be 
modified for this case 
Another alternative i s  to propagate the rules along the 
hierarchy as proposed in [Fern751 In that case the algorithm 
becomes much more efficient at the expense of the storage space 
required for all the propagated rules 
6 Conclusions and Further Work 
We have presented a model and a correspondiny 
algorithm to  validate authorization in object-oriented databases 
Further work i s  needed for 
0 Making the algorithm more efficient and general In 
particular we are considering how to handle multiple 
query nodes using Placement Rule 2 [Fern891 
0 Handle predicates The rule w i t h  the complete 
format, as described in Section 2, includes predicates 
I I4 
These have been ignored at this stage 
Determine access rules fo r  the  other types o f  
associations OSAM* has several other types These 
should be simpler than generalization but have to  be 
studied systematically 
0 Study administrative rights These are the rights 
needed t o  manipulate the schema and cont ro l  
authorization We have started considering this 
problem [Song891 
Consider the use of ordered access types As shown in  
[Fern751 th is  a l l o w s  a s i m p l i f i c a t i o n  i n  t h e  
administration and evaluation of security as well as a 
reduction in  storage requirements for these rules 
One can also define partial orders for user classes
